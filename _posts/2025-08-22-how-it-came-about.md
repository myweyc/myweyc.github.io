I’ve always loved stories. Growing up, I would beg my grandparents for just one more after dinner, while we sat under clear skies in a garden glowing with fireflies. Stories—told, read, or imagined—were my favorite part of the day.

Over the years, so many stories started living in my head, all waiting, almost screaming, to come out. I’ve never really had hobbies, and I don’t enjoy the chaos outside my home. When the pandemic hit, while many struggled with isolation, I found comfort in it. That stillness became a space for me to start journaling.

At first, I filled my phone with thoughts, poems, and small stories. But soon, the storage ran out—and paying for more wasn’t really an option. So I searched for better ways to keep everything in one place. I wasn’t ready to share any of it—I was scared. What if it wasn’t good? What if people thought it was a waste of time?

Eventually, I realized this wasn't about impressing anyone. I created this website as a personal home for my words—a place to store the poems, stories, and reflections that mean something to me. If someone stumbles across them and finds comfort or connection, that’s a beautiful bonus. But first and foremost, this space is for me.
